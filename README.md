The Pain Killers â€” The Impact of Opioid Prescriptions on Overdose Deaths (Bailley, Banerjee, Chalker

Introduction
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2020, 16,000 people died from an overdose of prescription opioids. That's 44 people per day who died from prescription painkillers, not street drugs.  (Source: <https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/deaths/prescription/maps.html>).  This project aims to understand the rates of opioid prescriptions and overdose deaths in the population being studied. Specifically, we investigate legal opioid prescriptions and overdose deaths at the state and county level. This exploratory data analysis provides visualizations and statistics to illustrate observed trends.
